The aim of this repository is to create a tool for reading and writing inventory information in Homebox using OpenWebUI. 

Valves will also be provided for Cloudflare authentication to reflect my personal setup. 

A later implementation will offer a version of the tool for those who do not have their instance protected by Cloudflare or who will be running both OpenWebUI and Homebox on the same local network. In such cases, Cloudflare authentication doesn't make sense.

Thanks to the Homebox team for recently publishing an OpenAPI compliant API. This API is added in the repository as a grounding reference document for an AI tool.
